# Easily consuming single-header C libraries in Python

This is a presentation I did on a technique I used for consuming 
single header C libraries from Python in a personal project, utilising
the hard work of other people so that I did not have to do any!

Demo code & [presentation](https://nathanrw.github.io/single-header-c-libs-in-python/).
